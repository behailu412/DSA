    "# Student Records Sorting Program\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python program manages and sorts student records using different sorting algorithms based on user selection. The program presents a menu-driven interface that allows users to sort student data by ID (using Bubble Sort), by name (using Insertion Sort), or by CGPA in descending order (using Selection Sort).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Structure**: \n",
    "   - Stores student records as a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary containing:\n",
    "     - `id`: Student ID (string)\n",
    "     - `name`: Student name (string)\n",
    "     - `dept`: Department (string)\n",
    "     - `cgpa`: Cumulative GPA (float)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Menu System**:\n",
    "   - Presents a continuous loop menu with these options:\n",
    "     1. Bubble sort by ID\n",
    "     2. Insertion sort by name\n",
    "     3. Selection sort by CGPA (descending order)\n",
    "     4. Exit program\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Sorting Algorithms**:\n",
    "   - **Bubble Sort**: Used for sorting by student ID in ascending order\n",
    "   - **Insertion Sort**: Used for sorting by student name in alphabetical order\n",
    "   - **Selection Sort**: Used for sorting by CGPA in descending order (highest first)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Display Function**:\n",
    "   - A unified display function that shows student data in a formatted table with columns for ID, Name, Department, and CGPA\n",
    "   - Shows both unsorted and sorted versions of the data for comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "## Program Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initializes with a predefined list of 10 student records\n",
    "2. Enters an infinite loop displaying the menu options\n",
    "3. Based on user input:\n",
    "   - Performs the selected sorting operation\n",
    "   - Displays the results in a tabular format\n",
    "   - For invalid inputs, shows an error message\n",
    "4. Continues until the user selects the exit option (4)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Technical Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bubble Sort Implementation**: Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, repeating until the list is sorted\n",
    "- **Insertion Sort Implementation**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by inserting each new item into its proper position\n",
    "- **Selection Sort Implementation**: Repeatedly finds the maximum element (for descending order) and moves it to the sorted portion\n",
    "- **Display Formatting**: Uses tab characters (`\\t`) for column alignment in the output\n",
    "\n",
    "The program demonstrates fundamental sorting algorithms applied to real-world data management, with clear separation of concerns between sorting logic and display functionality."

    "- Poor performance on reverse-sorted data\n",
    "- Not suitable for real-world applications with large dictionaries\n",

    "- Adaptive (faster when data is partially sorted)\n",
    "- Stable sorting (preserves order of equal names)\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Selection Sort (by CGPA)**\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Minimizes swaps (only O(n) swaps, good if writes are expensive)\n",
    "- Simple to implement\n",
    "- Consistent performance (always O(n²), regardless of input order)\n",
